This blog display needs a header, main content area, and footer.
This main content area needs to have a main area for actual content and at least one sidebar.
This site also needs a navigation bar that takes users to blog posts, an about page, and a recommended links links page.
This blog posts should include a date-time entry and tags.
This sidebar should include a list of months when a blog entry has been made, along with a list of tags used on blogs. Clicking on a month or tag should show a filtered list of blog entries.
Then modify this blog so that you can use blog entries as project entries, to include a video or screenshot. Visitors should be able to select a 'portfolio' tag to see your portfolio entries.
